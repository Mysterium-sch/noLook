# noLook

This code is for Cyber Partiots and I will add what each file should theroeticcaly do

noSecretCode: 
this is theroettically a bash script that when called using the following terminal lines:

Give execute permission to your script:
chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh

And to run your script:
/path/to/yourscript.sh

Since . refers to the current directory: if yourscript.sh is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:
./yourscript.sh

it should look for any file with the words malware/delete/phis/virus and ask if you want to delte each one.


noSecretPart2:

This should be copied and pasted directly into the terminal window. 
It should update eveyrthing, turn on firewall, and disable unnecessary services.

noSecretPart3:
This should be copied into the terminal window as well.
It should install and activate bitDefender on the device
